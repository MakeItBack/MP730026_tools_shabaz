## ble-multimeter-app
Used to provide remote access to the MP730026 multimeter display

To use, click here --> [ble-multimeter-app](https://shabaz123.github.io/MP730026_tools/ble-multimeter-app/)

If you're on Android and wish to optionally install the app, click on the Install pop-up that appears when you go to that page. If the pop-up does not appear, then click on the top-right **three-dots menu** in Android Chrome, and then select **Install App** in the drop-down menu.



***NOTE*** The app requires Chrome to run! It ***may*** run on other browsers, but only Chrome has been tested.

The reason is, it uses the web Bluetooth LE API, which is not supported on all web browsers.

Please check each range makes sense before relying on the app! Iâ€™m not liable for any issues, the code is for free with no guarantee, and is intended for engineers, to evaluate themselves.
